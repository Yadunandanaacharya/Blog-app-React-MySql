Express React Node MySql Blog App

#. Test project I've kept why because: in main app it's difficult to test api post and get request errors
or any sql errors i can easily test in test app as test app is small.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69864790/how-to-push-entire-react-folder-to-github
https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore from this link search react,node,expressengine click search in browser ctrl+s go to root folder ---> select all files ->save this file as .gitignore
-> next before end of above file add below code
# Ignore node_modules folder
/node_modules/

-> with above while pushing code to github it ignores node_modules folder so in repo size won't be increased.
